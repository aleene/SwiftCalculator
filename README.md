# Purpose
This application is written in Swift 2.1 using Xcode 7.2

The purpose for the application is getting to learn Swift. I follow the Stanford course by Paul Hegarty of spring 2015.

Each commit should follow a task in the project

## Status
* Project 2, Extra 2 - is the first commit

## Comments on specific tasks
### Project 2 - Extra 1 - operator precendence and parentheses
I have a bit of trouble getting my head around this task. As the hints say, this is only relevant to binary operations. The unary operations all add parentheses, i.e. #cos(...)# and #sqrt(...)#.

The top level should not show any parentheses, so 1+2 or 3/4 and not (1+2) or (3/4).

- At the simplest for (1 enter 2 enter 3 +) / I should see 1/(2+3).
- 1 enter 2 + 3 / should give (1+2)/3 and not 1+2/3

## Issues
* Project 2, Extra 1 missing before completion of project 2
